Nginx (pronounced as “Engine-X”) is an open source web server that is often used as reverse proxy or HTTP cache. It is available for Linux for free.

To install and configure Nginx on Ubuntu, follow these steps: 
1. Install Nginx: 
First, update your package lists and install Nginx using apt: 
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx

2. Adjust the Firewall: 
If you are using UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall), you need to allow Nginx traffic: 
sudo ufw app list

This will list available Nginx profiles. Choose the appropriate profile (e.g., Nginx Full for both HTTP and HTTPS, or Nginx HTTP for only HTTP) and enable it: 
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw status

3. Verify Nginx Installation: 
Nginx should start automatically after installation. Verify its status: 
systemctl status nginx

Then, open your web browser and navigate to http://your_server_ip. You should see the Nginx welcome page, confirming a successful installation. 
4. Basic Configuration (Server Blocks): 
For hosting multiple domains or custom configurations, you will use Nginx server blocks (similar to Apache virtual hosts). 

• Create a new configuration file for your domain in /etc/nginx/sites-available/: 

    sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/your_domain

• Add your server block configuration. A basic example for a static website: 

    server {
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80;

        root /var/www/your_domain;
        index index.html index.htm;

        server_name your_domain www.your_domain;

        location / {
            try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }
    }

• Create a symbolic link from sites-available to sites-enabled to activate the server block: 

    sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/your_domain /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/

• Test your Nginx configuration for syntax errors: 

    sudo nginx -t

Reload Nginx to apply the changes. 
    sudo systemctl reload nginx

5. Important Nginx Files and Directories: 

• /etc/nginx/: Nginx configuration directory. 
• /etc/nginx/nginx.conf: Main Nginx configuration file. 
• /etc/nginx/sites-available/: Directory for server block configuration files (not yet active). 
• /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/: Directory for active server block configurations (symlinks to sites-available). 
• /var/log/nginx/: Nginx access and error logs. 
• /var/www/html: Default web root directory. 

This provides a fundamental installation and configuration of Nginx on Ubuntu. Further configurations, such as SSL/TLS, reverse proxying, or advanced caching, require additional steps and specific directives within your server blocks.
