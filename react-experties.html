      <h2>10 Advanced &amp; Tricky React Native Questions &amp; Smart Answers</h2>
      <ul class="qa">
        <li>
          <div class="q">1. What will you do if your app becomes slow after adding many screens and features?</div>
          <div class="a">I start with profiling using Flipper and React DevTools to identify the bottleneck—whether it's unnecessary re-renders, heavy lists, or large API data. I optimize components with memoization, move heavy processing off the main thread, use FlatList correctly, and ensure minimal computation inside render functions.</div>
        </li>

        <li>
          <div class="q">2. How do you handle performance when rendering thousands of list items?</div>
          <div class="a">For large data lists, I use FlatList with windowSize, initialNumToRender, removeClippedSubviews, getItemLayout, and memoized card components. I also implement pagination or infinite scrolling so the app never loads all data at once.</div>
        </li>

        <li>
          <div class="q">3. How do you reduce the app bundle size?</div>
          <div class="a">I remove unused libraries, use ProGuard/Minify for Android, enable Hermes engine, optimize and compress images, use vector icons instead of heavy PNGs, and ensure no duplicate dependencies exist.</div>
        </li>

        <li>
          <div class="q">4. What if the app crashes only on production but not in development?</div>
          <div class="a">I check crash logs using services like Firebase Crashlytics or Sentry. Production crashes are often due to minification, missing permissions, or build configuration issues. I replicate the production environment locally using release builds and debug step-by-step.</div>
        </li>

        <li>
          <div class="q">5. Explain the difference between <code>useCallback</code>, <code>useMemo</code>, and <code>React.memo</code>.</div>
          <div class="a"><strong>useCallback</strong> → memoizes functions. <strong>useMemo</strong> → memoizes values. <strong>React.memo</strong> → memoizes components. I use these to prevent unnecessary renders, especially when passing props to child components.</div>
        </li>

        <li>
          <div class="q">6. How do you handle app-level errors and crashes gracefully?</div>
          <div class="a">I use an error boundary to catch UI crashes, integrate Crashlytics/Sentry for runtime crashes, validate API responses, and use global error handlers. This helps avoid white screens or app freezes.</div>
        </li>

        <li>
          <div class="q">7. How do you handle native module issues or when a library doesn’t work as expected?</div>
          <div class="a">I check compatibility with the RN version, re-link libraries if autolinking fails, review iOS Pod dependencies, clean build folders, and if required, debug the native code (Swift/Java/Kotlin) to fix the issue.</div>
        </li>

        <li>
          <div class="q">8. How do you manage sensitive data like tokens?</div>
          <div class="a">I never store sensitive data in AsyncStorage. Instead, I use encrypted storage, secure keychain/KeyStore, HTTPS communication, and rotate tokens securely through backend APIs.</div>
        </li>

        <li>
          <div class="q">9. When do you choose a native module over a JS-based solution?</div>
          <div class="a">I use native modules when I need access to device-specific features such as Bluetooth, background services, sensors, or when performance-critical tasks need native speed.</div>
        </li>

        <li>
          <div class="q">10. What is the benefit of using Hermes in React Native?</div>
          <div class="a">Hermes improves startup time, reduces memory usage, speeds up JS execution, and decreases app bundle size. It is especially useful for low-end Android devices.</div>
        </li>
